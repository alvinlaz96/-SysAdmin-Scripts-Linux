Don't worry, be happy.
You're not dead yet.
Don't give up, ever.
Dream big, believe bold!
You deserve some cake.
Dream it. Believe it. Build it.
I appreciate your work
Do what you love.
Try something new today.
You deserve a holiday.
Stand out, be original.
Make your life sweet.
Your limitation—it’s only your imagination.
Stay nice, not rude.
Let your sparkle shine!
You have the power
Volunteering makes a difference.
Live long and prosper.
God's love never fails.
Worry less, live more.
Embrace your inner superhero.
Don't think. Just do.
Remember to stay classy.
We're in this together.
Everybody Wang Chung tonight!
You look beautiful today.
Dream it. Wish it. Do it.
Dream bigger. Do bigger.
Little things make big days.
Don’t wait for opportunity. Create it.
When nothing goes right, go left.
I can and I will.
Take the risk or lose the chance.
Prove them wrong.
My life is my message.
Keep going. Be all in.
Fight till the last gasp.
Broken crayons still color. 
Stay hungry. Stay foolish.
Do it with passion or not at all.
The past does not equal the future.
Dream without fear. Love without limits
Each day provides its own gifts.
Work hard. Stay humble.
Feel the fear and do it anyway.
Enjoy the little things.
The eyes are useless when the mind is blind.
Try Again. Fail again. Fail better.
Impossible is for the unwilling.
Leave no stone unturned.
